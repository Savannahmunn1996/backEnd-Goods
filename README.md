## Description
This is a backend express.js API that I configured to use sequelize to interact with mysql database. This application was built around a relational database, which is just a collection of data that have expected relationships between them. The idea behind this was to simulate the backend functionality of an E-commerce platform similar to shopify. 


## Installation
Clone this repo to your local computer to begin using

## Usage
Once cloned:
- type command 'npm i' in terminal
- open another terminal for mysql and enter username and password
- source schema
- exit mysql
- seed database by using command 'npm run seed'
- type 'npm run watch' and server should say "Now Listening" in terminal
- navigate to Insomnia/Postman to test the routes
- feel free to create a frontend, go crazy!
